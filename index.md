# The Scope of Econometrics

**Econometrics is based upon the development of statistical methods for estimating economic relationships, testing economic theories, and evaluating/implementing government and business policy. Econometric methods can be used in areas that have nothing to do with macroeconomic forecasting. Still, the most common application of econometris is the forecasting of interest rates, inflation rates and gross domestic product.**

**Nonexperimental Data** - also called observational data or retrospective data

**Experimental Data** - Difficult to collect in social sciences (very expensive)

- Econometrics and mathmatical statistics both focus on multiple regression analysis, but the focus and interpretation in either field can differ drastically



## Emperical Economic Analysis

 - Uses data to test theory or to estimate a relationship
 
 - Requires data
 
 - Steps to performing emperical analysis:
 
   **1. Careful formulation of the question of interest**
      
      In some cases, a formal economic model is constructed (in the case of testing economic theories)
      
      **The basic premise in economic models is utility maximization** - in the case of consumption decisions, utility maximization leads to a let of demand equations
      
      In a demand equation, the quantity demanded of each commodity depends on the price of the goods, price of the substitute/complementary goods, consumer's income and the
      individual's characteristics that affect taste. These equations can form the basis of an econometric analysis of consumer demand.
